fiction-android [![Build Status](http://ci.yawk.at/job/fiction-android/badge/icon)](http://ci.yawk.at/job/fiction-android/)
===============

Modular android fanfiction client.

Main design goal of this iteration of my android fiction clients is easy extensibility - new fanfiction providers can be implemented quickly and will be integrated seamlessly.

**An Epub Reader is required on the device, I recommend [Moon+ Reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flyersoft.moonreader).**

Supported sites:
- [fanfiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/)
    + Story search
    + Story download with local story browsing
    + Mark chapters as read and browse locally depending on read status
- [fimfiction.net](https://www.fimfiction.net/)
    + Same features as *fanfiction.net*
    + User shelf support
    + Can use online read status instead of local
